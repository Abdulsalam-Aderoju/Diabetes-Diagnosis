Diabetes is a chronic malady that ensues when the pancreas does not yield sufficient insulin or when the body cannot effectively use the insulin it produces.
In 2014, 8.5% of adults 18 years and older had diabetes. In 2019, diabetes was the direct cause of 1.5 million deaths and 48% of all deaths due to diabetes occurred before the age of 70 years.
Contemporary meta analysis reported that approximately 5.8% (about 6million) adults Nigerians are living with diabetes, this figure has been likened to a tip of an iceberg as it is estimated that two-thirds of diabetes cases in Nigeria are yet to be diagnosed.
Nigerians suffer from an array of maladies that usually go undiagnosed due to lack of proper health care or insufficient funds to proceed with health maintenance.
To solve this problem as a Machine Learning Engineer, I have designed and built a model that would facilitate early diagnosis of diabetes in patients. This model would also reduce the cost of health care for its users.
